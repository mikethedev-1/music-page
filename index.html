      <h3>
YBNL’s new buzzing artist, Asake teams up with Grammy Award-winning artist, Burna Boy for the release of Sungba Remix.
      </h3>
      <p>
Throughout his debut EP, the eponymous Ololade Asake, the newbie incorporates Yoruba gospel and Fuji influences on bouncy beats to ruminate on his unfolding journey and show divine appreciation no surprises there, for an act with a name steeped in oriki (Yoruba praise poetry).
      </p>
      <p>
Because Afrobeats is inherently spiritual and the YBNL label remains one of its exalted cathedrals.
      </p>
      <p>
Off the Ololade EP Sugba went viral. Just like every other street jam, The second track is an infectious record with raw lyrics, typically asking a lady not be shy to flex because there is enough money to take care of her and in return, she needs to Sungbalaja.
      </p>
      <p>
Also produced by Magicsticks, this Remix is ready to take over!
